As stated under that guy's face to your left, I'm a PhD student at the University of Washington. I spend most of my time writing symbols down on paper and then throwing that paper away, or coding and then deleting it. I work with [Aleksandr Aravkin](https://uw-amo.github.io/saravkin/) on non-smooth, non-convex problems in optimization. As of April of 2017, I'm also a [DOE CSGF fellow](https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/). 

Apart from that, I run for [Club Northwest](https://www.clubnorthwest.org/), play guitar, and try to go to concerts.

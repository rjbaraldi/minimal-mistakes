<p>As stated under that guy's face to your left, I'm a PhD student at the University of Washington. I spend most of my time writing symbols down on paper and then throwing that paper away, or coding and then deleting it. I work with <a href="https://uw-amo.github.io/saravkin/">Aleksandr Aravkin</a> on non-smooth, non-convex problems in optimization. As of April of 2017, I'm also a <a href="https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/">DOE CSGF fellow</a>. 

Apart from that, I run for <a href="https://www.clubnorthwest.org/">Club Northwest</a>, play guitar, and try to go to concerts.
